You should now be able to run the following in a command line to get the version number of your Docker installation:

Getting the Docker version
docker --version
Which should return a version number like the following:

```sh  Docker version 27.1.1, build 63125853e3 ```



faucet : ```sh https://faucet.testnet.nillion.com/ ```



Initialising the accuser


Create a local directory to store state.

```sh mkdir -p nillion/accuser ```
Then initialise the accuser in the mounted directory.

```sh docker run -v ./nillion/accuser:/var/tmp nillion/retailtoken-accuser:v1.0.0 initialise .```
This will output the details needed to register the accuser on the website, register them below:

accound_id: Nillion address of the accuser
public_key: Public Key of the accuser
Note The accuser will store the credentials in a file called credentials.json in the folder that was created. If you lose this file, you will lose access to the keys/address of the accuser.





auto install : 
```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```










Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage compatible,
AngularJS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

- Type some Markdown on the left
- See HTML in the right
- ✨Magic ✨

## Features

- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.









## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm install --production
NODE_ENV=production node app
```

## Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |

## Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:

```sh
node app
```

Second Tab:

```sh
gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:

```sh
karma test
```

#### Building for source

For production release:

```sh
gulp build --prod
```

Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:

```sh
gulp build dist --prod
```

## Docker

Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
